					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> UI design is for communication, performance, and convenience. People perceive objects as a whole, and this is different to the sum of its parts. We can use the Gestalt Principles in our design to help us achieve the goals.  </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part is that the article talks about how we can relate the Gestalt principles to UI design. For example, we can use an "anomaly" to emphasize our point. We can also disrupt the continuity to end a section. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "Your brain is always trying to make sense of the world by comparing previous experiences or visual patterns and connecting the dots." </p>
						</li>
