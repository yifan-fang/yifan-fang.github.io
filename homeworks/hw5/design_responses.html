                            <p> My favorite inspiration is Landing Page Concept by Anton Mikhaltsov â—‘ for Awesomed. The dynamic nature of the design makes the landing page more interesting, and it also allows the users to view all the concepts one by one. There weren't other elements or movements that are distracting which I think is great. The accompanied figures on the right also makes the webpage more aesthtic, and the color choice is not distracting so users can focus on the texts on the left. </p>
