        <li> I learned that we should study apps instead of just using them to develop our product sense for designing. We need to think from the perspective of the designer and find out what was the purpose of each component on the app. </li>
        <li> I like how the author breaks down the app. Since the component shows up one by one, I'm able to focus on each component. I can think about why that component looks like this and what are some advantages and disadvantages. </li>
        <li> "You develop your design eye by thinking as if you were the designer of a product." </li>
