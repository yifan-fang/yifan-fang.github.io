					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>I learned that there are rules of using white space in a company/team to ensure visual consistency across all websites. It is critical to include white spaces because they bring "visual clarity" and help to "balance the layout". They also can draw users' attention to important things that we want the users to focus on: "the greater the padding, the greater the emphasis."</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>I like how the author brings in examples when introducing strategies. I also like the last part that talks about common concerns. It's helpful to see how other people may query your use of white spaces and how you can defend yourself from the perspective of user experience.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p>"When in doubt, add more white spaceâ€¦"</p>
						</li>
					</ul>
