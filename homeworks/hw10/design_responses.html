							<p>What are your thoughts on this article and its topic? Did it influence your opinion in any way? What were some interesting examples (good or bad)? (4-5 sentences)</p>
							<p>I'm taking the perception class now and it's interesting to see how the psychological effects can be used in UX designs. It definitely helps to know these effects so we can incorporate them in our design and intentionally drive users' attention to what we want them to see. An interesting example is is the use of visual hierarchy in design. By using size, color, and placement, designers can guide the user's attention to the most important elements of the interface and help them navigate more effectively. With some psychology knowledge, designers can create more effective and engaging user experiences. </p>
